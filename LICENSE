Change Date:            2024-08-25
Change License:         MPL2.0 (Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, included)
Additional Use Grant:   You may make use of the Licensed Work, provided
                        that you (or the aggregate usage of any users of
                        any service you provide) do not use the Licensed
                        Work to transact with, manage, or otherwise
                        control in excess of the Threshold Amount of assets
                        (including but not limited to Bitcoin) for any purpose
                        in the preceding year. The value of assets is determined
                        by the "At Risk Funds Rule" and "Integration Rule",
                        described below.

                        Should you exceed this limit, you have thirty days
                        to notify Licensor to procure a license before
                        your rights under the Additional Use Grant
                        terminate. Your notification, if you are in
                        breach, must include the amount of assets in
                        excess of the Threshold Amount exemption.
                        Notification may be by email to the Licensor
                        E-Mail.

                        Licensor has no obligation under this agreement to
                        inform you when you are in breach.


                        Integration Rule:

                        The value limitation cap is accounted for and
                        shared across any and all software you license
                        from Licensor, including past (unless the
                        Change Date has passed) or future versions of such
                        software. Should the Threshold Amount vary across
                        versions of a products, you may use the greater
                        amount. Should the Threshold Amount vary across
                        two different integrated software products, you
                        may use up to the lesser amount.

                        For the avoidance of doubt, use in the following
                        non-exhaustive list of situations are likely not
                        permitted:
                        1. You use service A with a Threshold of $5M, and
                           install a severally licensed Plugin B with a
                           Threshold of $250k, and use Plugin B for $5M in
                           transactions.



                        For the avoidance of doubt, use in the following
                        non-exhaustive list of situations are likely
                        permitted:
                        1. You use Licensor's Product A with a Threshold
                           Amount of $5M, and install a severally licensed
                           Plugin B by Licensor with a Threshold Amount of
                           $250k, and use Plugin B for $10,000 in
                           transactions.
                        2. You receive more than the Threshold Amount in
                           Bitcoin through a third party wallet and use the
                           Licensed Work to create a new transaction spending
                           the Threshold Amount.



                        At Risk Funds Rule:

                        If the sum total value of the user's assets over
                        the period that could be lost, misappropriated, or
                        otherwise diminished by a malfunction in the
                        Licensed Work exceeds the Threshold Amount, the
                        use is not permitted. The user's use of
                        mitigations or external protections to prevent
                        malfunction in the Licensed Work are not to be
                        considered in the evaluation of this rule.

                        For avoidance of doubt, use in following
                        non-exhaustive list of situations are likely not
                        permitted:
                        1. You use Licensed Work version 1 up to the
                           Threshold Amount and then separately use Licensed
                           Work version 2 up to the Threshold Amount.
                        2. You receive one tenth of the Threshold Amount a
                           day using the Licensed Work, but immediately spend
                           it, you would be in violation on the eleventh day.
                        3. You use the Licensed Work on an air-gapped
                           machine with more than the Threshold Amount and
                           validate all operations using your own software on
                           a different machine.

                        Under the following non-exhaustive list of
                        situations you likely would be permitted:
                        1. You use the Licensed Work after the Change
                           Date to manage more than the Threshold Amount.
                        2. You deposit the Threshold Amount of Bitcoin
                           using the Licensed Work, and use the coins within the
                           Licensed Work.
                        3. You deposit 1/10th the Threshold Amount into
                           the Licensed Work, and use only that 1/10th amount
                           in a series of 100 transactions such that your
                           total assets are not in excess of the Threshold
                           Amount.

2.7. Conditions

in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

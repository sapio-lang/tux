# Parametrized MariaDB Contributor Agreement (PMCA)


These terms apply to your contribution of materials to a product or project
owned or managed by us ('project'), and set out the intellectual property
rights you grant to us (The "Entity") in the contributed material. If
this contribution is on behalf of a company, the term 'you' will also mean the
company you identify below. If you agree to be bound by these terms, fill in
the information requested below and provide your signature. Read this agreement
carefully before signing.

* The term 'contribution' means any source code, object code, patch, tool,
  sample, graphic, specification, manual, documentation, or any other material
  posted, committed or submitted by you to a project. Each submission must
  explicitly be marked that it's donated under the PMCA.
* With respect to any worldwide copyrights, or copyright applications and
  registrations, in your contribution:
    * you hereby assign to us joint ownership, and to the extent that such
       assignment is or becomes invalid, ineffective or unenforceable, you hereby
       grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge,
       royalty-free, unrestricted license to exercise all rights under those
       copyrights. This includes, at our option, the right to sub-license these
       same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sub-licensees or
       other licensing arrangements;
    * you agree that each of us can do all things
       in relation to your contribution as if each of us were the sole owners, and
       if one of us makes a derivative work of your contribution, the one who makes
       the derivative work (or has it made) will be the sole owner of that
       derivative work;
    * you agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your contribution
      against us, our licensees or transferees;
    * you agree that we may register a copyright in your contribution and exercise
      all ownership rights associated with it; and
    * you agree that neither of us has any duty to consult with, obtain the
       consent of, pay or render an accounting to the other for any use or
       distribution of your contribution.
* With respect to any patents you grant licenses to without payment to any third party,
  which would restrict us from using the contributed code as if we would own a
  shared copyright to it, you hereby grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable,
  non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to:
    * make, have
      made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer your
      contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination with or included in
      any product, work or materials arising out of the project to which your
      contribution was submitted, and
    * at our option, to sub-license these same rights to third parties through multiple
      levels of sub-licensees or other licensing arrangements.
    * Note that you don't give us rights to the patent in any other way than to give us the
   right to freely use the contributed code in the above ways.
* Except as set out above, you keep all right, title, and interest in your contribution.
  The rights that you grant to us under these terms are effective on the date
  you first submitted a contribution to us, even if your submission took place
  before the date you sign these terms. Any contribution we make available
  under any license will also be made available under a suitable FSF (Free
  Software Foundation) or OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved license.
* With respect to your contribution, you represent that:
    * it is an original work and that you can legally grant the rights set out in these
      terms;
    * it does not to the best of your knowledge violate any third party's copyrights,
      trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights; and
    * you are authorized to sign this contract on behalf of your company (if
       identified below).
* These terms will be governed by the laws of the Finland. Any choice of law rules will
  not apply.
